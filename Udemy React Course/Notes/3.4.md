## Props

`Person.js`

```js
import React from 'react';

const person = (props) => {
  return <p>Hello {props.name} who is {props.age} years old.</p>;
}

export default person;
```

`App.js`

```js
import Person from './Person/Person';

...

<Person name="Laura" age="20" />
```

## Children

- Children is what you pass as the content in a component. Can be anything, including a string, html, or even another component.
- `props.children` is a property already defined in React.
- Note, if children is undefined, the html tag surrounding it still gets rendered with no content.

`Person.js`

```js
import React from 'react';

const person = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {props.name} who is {props.age} years old.</p>;
      <p>{props.children}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default person;
```

`App.js`

```js
import Person from './Person/Person';

...

<Person name="Laura" age="20" >Hello there!</Person>
```
