## State

- Only works in a class & has to extend `Component`.
- Allows a component to modify itself without passing in props from a parent component.
- Properties are managed within the component.
- If state changes, React will update the DOM for that one component.
- State is different than props because you don't receive the new data from outside that component.
- Mutating the data simply means changing it.

`App.js`

```js
import Person from './Person/Person';

class App extends Component {
  // `state` is a JS object reserved for managing state data
  state = {
    // `person` is another JS object
    person: [
      { name: 'Laura', age: '20' },
      { name: 'foobar', age: '42' }
    ],
    // This does not get touched when `setState` is called on `person`
    otherState: 'some other value'
  }

  switchNameHandler = () => {
    // Don't want to use `this` inside this function because it won't refer to the class at runtime.

    // `this.state.persons[0]`.name = "New name" won't work because we don't want to mutate the state directly.

    // `setState` is made available by the React library because we extend component
    this.setState( {
      // The original `person` array will be overwritten by this one.
      person: [
        { name: 'Chungo', age: '20' },
        { name: 'foobar', age: '42' }
      ]
    } )
  }

  render() {
    return (
      // Don't use `switchNameHandler()` because this will execute it immediately
      // `this.switchNameHandler` is a reference to a function
      <button onClick={this.switchNameHandler}>Switch</button>

      // `this` refers to the class (ES6 syntax)
      <Person name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age} >Hello there!</Person>
    )
  }
}
```
