Note: A **bundler** is a way of shipping code that is not in multiple files and can be interpreted by the browser, i.e, **Webpack**.

## Creating a React App

Follow setup instructions for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Important files:

**package.json:** dependencies and versioning.

**public/index.html:** only need one of these files.

- `<div id="root"></div>`: mount our React app.

**public/manifest.json:** define metadata about application.

**src/index.js:** main index file of our application.

- `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));` how we render our app after mounting.

**src/App.js:**

- The first React component in our starting project. This is the root. We nest all further components into this.

- Always need to `render()` some html to the dom.

- `export default App;` means that we can import this _whole_ class.

**src/App.css** & **src/index.css:** globally scoped general styles.
