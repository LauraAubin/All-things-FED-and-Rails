<!-- Module 3: Adding style with CSS

Style and link tags:


Link your css file from within application: -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/my_styles.css">

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Selectors and Declarations:


p { color: blue }

      p: selector (applies style to all p tags)
      { color: blue }: declaration (property values)

CSS Properties:


Units: px, em, %, vh

Font size:
    - xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large.
    - Relative sizing (relative to parent text): larger, smaller.

Line height:
    - space between rows of text.
    - Set number without a unit to inherit from the font-size value.

Text align:
    - Does not work if text is inline (does not move to a new line when
      used) Inline examples: --> <span>, <a>, <i>, <b>, <q>.
    <!-- Works on block level tags such as: --> <p>, <li>, <ol>, <div>, <blockquote>.
    <!-- - Use 'start' and 'end' instead of left and right.
    - Justify makes all of the spaces inbetween things horizontally equal.

Font family:
    - Checks if browser supports first font, if not, goes through the list looking
      for the next best alternative.

Margin:
    - Spacing away from immediate neighbors.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Units:


px:
  - pixels
  - may not work due to browser zooming, retina displays.

em:
  - Vertical dimensions. ONe 'em' maps to the height of one capital letter.
  - Relative to the page base size, its parent.

rem:
  - Gets size relative to the root.
  - Set root size with html and body selectors: -->

    html, body { font-size: 20px; }

<!-- %:
  - Percentage relative to parent dimension.
  - Parent must have an explicit width or height set.

vh / vw:
  - Viewport height and viewport width.
  - Percentage of screen/viewport.

Styling lists:


list-style-type:
      - For markers positioned on the left of a list item.
      - (disc, circle, square, none). -->

      li { list-style-type: disc; }

      <!-- For ordered lists:
        - Can choose different ways of having the numbers shown.
        - (decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower-roman, upper-roman, lower-alpha, upper-alpha).


list-style-position:
      - How close list item is positioned to the list itself.
      - (inside, outside).


list-style-image:
      - Change marker on list to an image.
      - If scaling is not accurate, try the 'background-image' property. -->

      li { list-style-image: url("my_triangle.png"); }

Selectors:


Tag selector:
      - Applies to matching tags on the page. -->

      li { list-style-type: circle; }


<!-- Id selector:
      - Style something individually with a unique identifier. -->

      #p18 { color: blue; }

      <p id="p18">Text.</p>


<!-- Class selector:
      - Can be applied to many tags

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Combining selectors:


Comma separated selectors:
              - Instead of making duplicate classes, we can separate common
                classes with a comma and style them all at the same time. -->

                blockquote, q, .speech { color: red; }

              <!-- - To style one of these, add an additional style: -->

              .speech { font-weight: bold; }


<!-- Specialized selectors:
              - Two selectors of different types appearing next to each other
                with no spacing separating them.
              - Combining selectors.
              - Doesn't apply to individual selectors, but only when they are
                joined (Ex, blockquote does not get styled unless it has the
                speech class).
              - Can combine multiple classes. -->

                blockquote.speech { font-color: green; }


<!-- Descendant selectors
              - If there are different ID's, but similar tags, this is used to
                style those tags based on the ID. -->

                #id1 a { color: red; }
                #id2 a { color: blue; }


<!-- Direct descendant selectors ( > ):
              - Apply style to direct child. -->

              #intro > a { font-size: large; }


<!-- Everything selector (*):
            - To make the direct children of a body styled: -->

            body > * { margin-left: 10px; }

            <!-- - To style the children of any paragraph text: -->

            p * { text-decoration: underline; }

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Cascading: inheritance and precedence:


Inheritance:
    - All children inherit the same styles, with exceptions for margin, padding,
      position, width, border, backgrounds...
    - The 'inherit' value leverages inheritance from the parent to reduce
      repetition. This is used on properties that don't inherit. (as mentioned ^)

    Ex, -->

    Parent CSS: padding: 40px;
    Child CSS: padding: inherit;

    <!-- - Properties associated with position, layout are not inherited.
    - Decorative properties (borders, background images, etc) do not inherit.
    - Most properties that begin with text- or font- inherit.


Precedence (conflicting rules):

    1 - Most Specific Rule:
                - Ex, when styling a span inside a list, the second more specific
                  one will be applied: -->

                span { color: blue; }
                ul li span { color: red; }

    <!-- 2 - #id selector is the most specific.

    3- .class selector is more specific than a tag selector.

    4- Rules of the same selector that come later override those that come earlier.


    !important, takes total precedence: -->

      p { color: orange !important; }
