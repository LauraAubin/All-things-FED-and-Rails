## Creating a React App

Follow setup instructions for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Important files:

`package.json`: dependencies and versioning.

`public/index.html`: only need one of these files.
- `<div id="root"></div>`: mount our React app.

`public/manifest.json`: define metadata about application.

`src/index.js`: main index file of our application.
- `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));` how we render our app after mounting.

`src/App.js`: the first React component in our starting project.

`src/App.css` & `src/index.css`: globally scoped general styles.
