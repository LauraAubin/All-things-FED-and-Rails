## DEV:

**Test all files:**
- `dev test` usually works, but sometimes it only tests files that have been edited.
- `dev test -a` will test all files anyways.

**Run an individual test:**
- `dev test [/file directory] --name /[test_name_with_underscores]/`

<hr>

**To quickly navigate to a Rails app page: **
- Make sure the server is running.

**Open Atom from terminal: **
- Navigate to the folder for your repo.
