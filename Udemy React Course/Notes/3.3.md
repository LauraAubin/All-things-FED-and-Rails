## Creating a Functional Component

### Notes:
- Component folder names should start with a capital.
- Can create a `Name.js` file for your component.
- A function is used for basic components, i.e, when there is no state.
- Can output JS in JSX by wrapping it in `{ }`.

i.e,


`Person.js`

```js
import React from 'react';

const person = () => {
  return <p>Hello</p>;
}

export default person;
```

`App.js`

```js
import Person from './Person/Person';

...

<Person />
```

Note: Use an uppercase first letter so that React identifies it as a custom component.
