## Javascript

**Var, Let, and Const**

- var is function scoped (scope is limited to the function it was defined in)
- let is used for values, is block scoped (specific to the block it was defined in)
- const is for constant values, global

<br>

**Arrow functions**

Used for function notation, and eliminates issues with using the `this` keyword.

```js
function myFnc() {
}
```

```js
const myFnc = () => {
}
```

<br>

**Exports & Imports (Modules)**

`person.js`

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Max'
}

export default person
```

In another file we can import the person like `import prs from ./person.js`. We can use any name for the import since we used a default export in the person.js file.

If we don't use default, we have to explicitly mark what we exported. For example, if we have a file `utility.js` that looks like,

```js
export const cat = () => {...}
export var dog = 10;
```

Then we need to import these exports by their name such as `import {cat} from './utility.js'` and `import {dog} from './utility.js'`.

You can also assign an alias like:
`import {cat as kitten} from './utility.js'`

If you have multiple named exports in a file, you can import all of them with the `*` operator like: `import * as bundled from './utility.js'`. In this case, `bundled` is a JS object that exposes all constants for everything you exported in the other file as properties. Ex, `bundled.thing`.

<br>

**Classes**

- Classes can have both properties and methods
- Can create JS objects with classes

Example:

```js
class Person {
  name = 'Max'
  call = () => {...}
}
```

```
const myPerson = new.Person()
myPerson.call()
console.log(myPerson.name)
```

Inheritance:

`class Person extends Human` means that the Person class will inherit from the Human class. If we want Person to call a Human's method, then we may get an error `must call super constructor in derived class`. You will need to call `super()` in the Person constructor which executes the parent constructor which is needed to initialize the parent class.

<br>

**The Spread & Rest Operator** `...`

Spread: Used to split up array elements OR object properties

```js
const oldArray = [1, 2]
const newObject = {color: "red", value: 1}

const array = [oldArray, 3, 4] // [[1, 2], 3, 4]
const newArray = [...oldArray, 3, 4] // [1, 2, 3, 4]

const newObject = {...oldObject, newProp: 5} // {color: "red", value: 1, newProp: 5}
```
<sup>Note: If the old object had a property, the new object will overwrite it.</sup>

Rest: Used to merge a list of function arguments into an array

- Args is unlimited

```js
function sortArgs(...args) {
  return args.sort() // args is an array
}
```

<br>

**Destructuring**

- Pull out single elements or object properties and store them in variables

Array destructuring

```js
[a, ,b] = ['Hello', 'there', 'Max']
console.log(a) // Hello
console.log(b) // Max
```

Object destructuring

```js
{name} = {name: 'Max', age: 28}
console.log(name) // Max
console.log(age) // undefined
```

<br>

**Reference and Primitive Types**

Primitive type: Strings and numbers.

```js
const number = 1; // Creates a primitive type
const num2 = number; // Creates a real copy of 1
```

Reference type: Objects and arrays.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Max'
};

const secondPerson = person; // stores a pointer to person

person.name = 'Laura';
console.log(secondPerson.name); // 'Laura'


// TO MAKE A REAL COPY:

const secondPerson = {
  ...person // copy properties instead of whole object
}

person.name = 'Laura';
console.log(secondPerson.name); // 'Max'
```

<br>

**Refreshing Array Functions**

Given an array of numbers, double each element. We can use `map`.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const doubleMyNumbers = numbers.map((returnVariable) => {
  return returnVariable * 2;
});

console.log(doubleMyNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
```
