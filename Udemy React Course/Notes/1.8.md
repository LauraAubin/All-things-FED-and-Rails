## Part 8: Understanding Single Page Applications and Multi Page Applications

### Single Page

- One HTML page
- Entire page is made up of components that are rendered/handled by JS
- Content is re(rendered) on **client**
- Allows us to use React Router
- Only one `ReactDOM.render()` call
     - Only need one because we have one root app component which is mounted to the DOM which hosts all of the other components

### Multi Page

- Mutliple HTML pages
- Entire page is not made up of React, only some of the components
- Content is rendered on **server**
- Calls `ReactDOM.render()` more often
- Widgets don't know of each other's existence
